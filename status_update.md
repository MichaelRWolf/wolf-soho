## What's Next

**Step 4.5: Disable Web Hosting for runningwolf.net**

You're currently at the Fastmail DNS management page where you can see all the DNS records. You need to:

1. **Disable the A records** that enable web hosting:
   - Root domain A records (103.168.172.37 and 103.168.172.52)
   - Wildcard subdomain A records (same IPs)
   
2. **Keep these enabled**:
   - All MX records (for email)
   - mail.runningwolf.net A record (for webmail access)

3. **Save the changes**

After this, you'll move to **Step 5: Configure Email Addresses** to create michael@ and wendy@ email addresses.

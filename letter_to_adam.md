# Letter to Adam - Request for advice

## Goal

Create simple letter to Adam requesting assistance to improve our internet experience.

## Background

- Adam set up the WiFi network during summer visits 3 and 4 summers ago.
- Adam owns a farm down south.  Was here 2 summers consulting to start up Soul&Soil farm on grounds of Trails End Campground.  Compensated as an owner.  Considered WiFi to be just another farm system.
- Network is mostly Unifi.  
- Has cloud thingy in barn.  
- AP's at registration center, camp site 2, pump house, Katya's camp site, others?.
- Tried to incorporate wolf into network 2 summers ago.  Didn't have time to finish it.
- We limped along last summer.
- Want more stability this summer.
- I am willing to contribute to existing shared network rather than create and maintain my own.
- Prefer to work with Adam, but will take introduction to Jeff if that
doesn't work for him. Jeff is not as welcoming and likely knows less
than Adam about the setup.

## Tone

Friendly.  Apprecative.  Asking a favor.  Relying on relatedness from previous 3 summers as "part of the vision".

## Flow

- Appreciation for work on the pipes (water and data) at the farm/camp ground.
- Internet is on the edge.  A few things I've tried have made incremental improvement.
- I understand there have been changes, but don't know the extent.  Is it OK to ask you for aadvice on my next steps?

- My final shot at handling this alone was misguided.  I thought that I could use the same device that Katya uses, but configure it to "stand-alone mode" instead of factory default (mesh) mode.  That is incorrect.  I now know that I can not **attach to** the Unifi mesh, but must, rather, be **adopted by** the mesh.  See appendix for suggestions, but first, is this something you can assist with or direct me on?

Appendix:
- Unifi device - model, MAC address
- Alternatives
 1. Adopt my device into existing mesh.  It will become become part of the mesh.  Anyone can attach via my device with no observable difference.
 2. Create similar structure to "Trails End Crew" or "Lake Effect Farm", say "Wolf Enterprises" or "Wolf Den".

## Draft Letters

### Draft #1

Dear Adam,

I hope this finds you well. I wanted to reach out and express my appreciation for all the work you've done over the past few summers setting up the infrastructure here at Trails End - both the water systems and the data network. Your vision of treating WiFi as just another farm system has really made a difference for everyone here.

We've been experiencing some internet connectivity challenges this summer, and I've made a few incremental improvements on my own, but I'm hitting the limits of what I can accomplish without deeper knowledge of the network setup. I understand there have been some changes to the system since you were here last, and I'm not sure of the current state.

I'm reaching out to ask for your advice on next steps. My latest attempt to solve this myself was misguided - I purchased a UniFi AC Mesh device (same model Katya uses) thinking I could configure it in "stand-alone mode" to attach to the existing mesh. I now realize that's not how UniFi mesh networks work - I can't simply attach to the mesh, but rather need to be adopted by it.

Here's what I'm working with:
- Device: Ubiquiti UAP-AC-M-US
- MAC Address: D8:B3:70:CC:AA:7C
- Current status: Factory reset, ready for adoption

My preference would be to contribute to the existing shared network rather than create and maintain my own separate system. If my device could be adopted into the existing mesh, it would become part of the network infrastructure, and anyone could connect through it seamlessly with no observable difference.

Is this something you'd be able to assist with, or could you point me in the right direction? I'd much rather work with you given our history and your understanding of the setup, but I'm also open to an introduction to Jeff if that would work better for you.

Thanks for considering this, and I appreciate all you've done to make this place work so well.

Best regards,
Michael

# Donate estate contents from Neil's Snowboarders House

## Plan

Step - Refine goal and context âœ…
Step - Target organizations that may know interested individuals
Step - Contact these organizations

## Goal

Donate electronic, computer, audio, video, and radio equipment from an estate of a life-time radio/electronics enthusiast

Priorities:
- Donate equipment to working professionals or students
- Keep out of landfill
 Tax benefits are NOT a priority

## Context

- Estate house basement and 2 outbuildings are filled with electronics equipment.
- New owner does not recognize value of the equipment
- New owner would rather donate equipment than send to land fill
- Most is in working condition
- Approximately 50% has historical/museum value
- Approximately 50% would be useful for daily use

- Partial equipment list
  - Satellite dishes ranging from 10 feet (1980's?) to 2 feet (recent)
  - Tektronics oscilliscope
  - HP equipment - signal generators, analyzers, others?
  - Microwave receivers
  - Microwave wave guides
  - Roof-top antennas
  - Electronic assembly tools (soldering iron, hand tools, small components)
  - Test equipment
  - Audio/Video cabling and switches
  - Parts bins full of components
  - Historical computer/electronics and radio equipment dating back to 1970's (maybe earlier)
  - Most of equipment is still in working order
  - Some may be interesting from historical perspective for museum

- Available for immediate viewing.
- Donated for $0.00.
- As-is condition

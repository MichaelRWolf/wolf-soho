# Cursor Rules for wolf-soho project

## TODO Management
- ALWAYS number todo lists when displaying them
- Use numbered format: 1. 2. 3. etc.
- This applies to all todo displays, not just creation

## Project Preferences
- User prefers stable, proven solutions over experimental approaches
- User prefers to say 'continue' rather than 'resume' when asking to continue where left off
- User expects pre-commit hooks to run normally and dislikes bypassing them with --no-verify
- User prefers to perform git commands themselves and assistant should remind them rather than run git commands automatically
- In this project, the markdown linter is markdownlint and you should use 'markdownlint --fix' to check and fix markdown formatting issues

## Instruction Following
- Follow user instructions exactly as given - do not add unrequested steps
- If asked to "analyze then commit only staged files", do exactly that: analyze staged files, then commit them
- Do NOT stage files unless explicitly asked to do so
- Do NOT commit files unless explicitly asked to do so
- If no staged files exist when asked to commit staged files, report this and wait for further instructions

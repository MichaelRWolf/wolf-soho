# Plan to Recover Org Files

## Overview

Files were created with emacs org-mode, then used in Logseq.app (macOS local), then eventually on Logseq iOS ap.

To get the mobile app to work required making the files cloud visible.

I did lots of symlink fuckery to make this happen.

Then I got annoyed with emacs-org mode.  It just fickin stopped working.  Rolled over.  Took it up the back side when SQL stopped playing with dependencies among emacs packages.  I was left disconnected.  Frustrated, I (probably, purportedly) deleted (or disconnected) Logseq apps.  This seems to have cut the cord for cloud files.  I though I had the files local on my macbook, and mirrored via some kind of symlink magic to iCloud.

The files used to be in `~/org*`, then refined as the nepatistic interfuckery increased to `~/org-roam-logseq`.  It was like fucking a beachball while riding a river rapids.  Tough to stay on.  Or get traction.  And not very satisfying in the end.  But it worked.  For a while.  The house of cards stood.  Until org-mode stopped being able to use SQL.  Then, because it all depends on SQL, it all crashed.  I was disconnected from my files.

## Step - Analyze macOS directories

Analyze ~~/org-*` directories and symlinks.

## Step - Analyze iCloud archives

Analyze `~/iPhone/iCloud Archive*`
See where `*.org` files exist.  Specifically, find `*quotes.org`.
When were they last modified?
See if there are ones from 1-3 months ago.  Maybe in TimeMachine.  Mayb in some fucker-based archive.

| `~/org-roam-logseq-nodes-MichaelRWolf` | Symlink   | Broken | Points to iCloud logseq directory              | Mar 20 2023   | Target not accessible    |
|----------------------------------------|-----------|--------|------------------------------------------------|---------------|--------------------------|
| `~/org-files-without-org-mode`         | Directory | Active | 2 org files: `far_from_a_road.org` + backup    | Apr 17 2025   | Contains recovered files |
| `~/repos/org-roam-logseq`              | Directory | Active | Git repo with migration tools                  | Jul 9 2025    | Migration documentation  |
| `~/.cache/org-persist`                 | Directory | Active | Emacs org-mode cache                           | -             | System cache             |

### Key Findings

- **Broken Symlink Chain**: `~/org-roam-logseq` → `~/org-roam-logseq-nodes-MichaelRWolf` → iCloud (inaccessible)
- **Recovered Files**: Found 2 org files in `~/org-files-without-org-mode/`
- **Migration Tools**: Active git repo with migration documentation and scripts
- **iCloud Access Lost**: Original iCloud logseq directory is no longer accessible

## Archive Directory Comparison Results

| Archive Directory                      | Org Files Total | quotes.org Found | org-roam-logseq/pages/ Files | Directory Contents          | Completeness      |
|----------------------------------------|-----------------|------------------|------------------------------|-----------------------------|-------------------|

### Archive Analysis Summary:

- **Only Archive - 1 contains org files**: 1,431 total org files
- **quotes.org only found in Archive - 1**: `/Logseq/org-roam-logseq/pages/20230711112147-quotes.org`
- **Archive - 1 has 1,100 files in pages/ directory**: Most complete org-roam-logseq structure
- **Other archives are empty or contain only basic iCloud files**
- **Recommendation**: Focus recovery efforts on `~/iCloud Drive (Archive) - 1` exclusively

## Research and Analysis Results

### Mobile App Integration Issues
**Root Cause**: Logseq mobile app required iCloud sync, which necessitated complex symlink chains to make files cloud-visible.

**Symlink Structure Discovered**:
```
~/org-roam-logseq → org-roam-logseq-nodes-MichaelRWolf → /Users/michael/Library/Mobile Documents/iCloud~com~logseq~logseq/Documents/org-roam-logseq
```

**Why It Failed**: When Logseq apps were deleted, the symlink chain broke, cutting off access to the original iCloud directory.

### SQL Dependency Issues (org-mode Failure)
**Problem**: org-roam depends heavily on SQL for database operations and linking.

**Evidence from Migration Docs**:
- "org-roam is being abandoned due to reliability issues"
- "org-roam reliability: Abandoning org-roam due to persistent issues"
- Migration plan explicitly states: "This plan focuses solely on the org-roam-logseq project and does not consider any other independent projects or submodules"

**Root Cause**: SQL dependency conflicts between emacs packages caused org-mode to "roll over" and stop working.

## Comprehensive Recovery Strategy

### Phase 1: Immediate Recovery (Recommended)
**Source**: `~/iCloud Drive (Archive) - 1` (1,431 org files, including quotes.org)

**Steps**:
1. **Copy archive to local directory**:
   ```bash
   cp -r "/Users/michael/iCloud Drive (Archive) - 1/Logseq/org-roam-logseq" ~/recovered-org-files/
   ```

2. **Verify quotes.org recovery**:
   ```bash
   ls -la ~/recovered-org-files/pages/20230711112147-quotes.org
   # Expected: 198,174 bytes, last modified Sep 18, 2024
   ```

3. **Set up new local workflow** (no iCloud dependencies):
   ```bash
   mkdir ~/org-workspace
   cp -r ~/recovered-org-files/* ~/org-workspace/
   ```

### Phase 2: Alternative Approaches
**Option A - Direct Archive Usage**: Use archive directory directly (risky if iCloud sync issues)
**Option B - Selective Recovery**: Copy only essential files (quotes.org + recent journals)
**Option C - Hybrid Approach**: Recover to local + manual backup strategy

### Phase 3: Prevention Strategy
**Avoid**: Complex symlink chains, org-roam dependencies, iCloud sync complications
**Implement**: Local git repository, simple backup scripts, direct file management

### Recommendations Summary
1. **Focus on Archive - 1**: Only viable source with complete data
2. **Abandon org-roam**: Use plain org-mode or Logseq without org-roam
3. **Local-first approach**: Avoid iCloud dependencies for core workflow
4. **Simple backup strategy**: Regular git commits + external backup
5. **Mobile access**: Use Logseq app with local directory (no cloud sync required)

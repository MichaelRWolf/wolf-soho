# AT&T Loging Fuckery

## 2025-08-13

### Problem

My  iphone can get mail from att.net. The password has not changed. Yet webmail on att.net and mail.app on macbook are refusing to sign in. More at&t fuckery. I really do not want to start a 1 hour password change/rechange/rechange/rechange redistribute-to-all-devices in a timing race condition fuckery. What's a good way to use iphone to convince macbook and chrome that I really do know my password and that at&t is fucked again. How to unfuck them?

### ChatGPT Suggestions

Got it — you want a way to **leverage the fact that your iPhone is already logged in** to bypass AT\&T's broken sign-in process on your MacBook and Chrome, without triggering their "reset password" circus.

Here's the practical, minimal-frustration approach:

---

### 1. **Check if your iPhone can give you a "real" session cookie or token**

If your iPhone Mail app is still pulling messages, then AT\&T's IMAP/SMTP authentication is fine — it's just the *webmail* (via browser) and Mac Mail that are choking.

* On your iPhone, go to **Safari** and try to log in to [currently.att.yahoo.com](https://currently.att.yahoo.com) or [mail.yahoo.com](https://mail.yahoo.com).

  * If it works there, you now have an active browser session on your iPhone.
  * You can use **iCloud Keychain** to sync that saved password across devices — no retyping or re-entering required.
  * Sometimes, logging in via Yahoo's portal instead of AT\&T's triggers a working session that Mac Mail can then accept.

---

### 2. **Try "app-specific password" for the MacBook**

AT\&T/Yahoo sometimes blocks logins if they detect "older" mail clients. You can:

* In AT\&T/Yahoo account security settings (on iPhone Safari), create an **app password**.
* Use that app password in Mac Mail instead of your normal one.
  (This avoids AT\&T thinking the Mac is "suspicious.")

---

### 3. **Token-sharing workaround (cookies export)**

If you can get AT\&T Webmail working in Safari on your iPhone:

* Use a browser extension on Mac (like *EditThisCookie* in Chrome) to **import cookies** from the iPhone session.

  * You can export them on iPhone via **Safari Developer > Remote Automation** (requires enabling Web Inspector in iOS settings and connecting via USB to your Mac).
  * This gives Chrome the *exact same logged-in session*, skipping the password prompt.

---

### 4. **Use iCloud Keychain password sync**

If your iPhone already has the correct password saved in Safari/Keychain:

* Go to **System Settings > Apple ID > iCloud > Passwords & Keychain** on both devices — turn it on.
* Once synced, just choose the autofilled password on Mac Mail/Chrome instead of typing it.
* This prevents typos or "wrong password" rejections caused by AT\&T's janky login parser.

---

### 5. **Bypass AT\&T's own portal**

Sometimes AT\&T's own login page is down while Yahoo's backend is fine.

* Go straight to: [https://mail.yahoo.com](https://mail.yahoo.com)
  and use your full att.net email as username.
* If you can log in there on Mac, it will often start working in Mac Mail without changing passwords.

---

If you want, I can give you a **step-by-step for the "cookie transplant" trick** so your Chrome and Mac Mail think you're already logged in like your iPhone is — no password re-entry at all.

Do you want me to write that out? That's the most bulletproof way to avoid AT\&T's "password change" trap.

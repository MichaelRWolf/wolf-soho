Offering this service in good faith includes taking reasonable measures to protect and preserve user content, as well as making it easy for people to take their content with them for any reason (I assume that Atlassian does not provide a tool to conveniently do this, as it would harm user lock-in, but I may be wrong). Ultimately, they are free to change their commercial terms, but they still have a responsibility to protect user content to the best of their abilities. Regulation could, for example, require companies to archive user accounts for a full year after termination in a portable format (like markdown) and contact users repeatedly via multiple channels if possible.

At the time of deactivation, the site admin still has *another* 60 days to reactivate their account.\n\nThis means your friend managed to ignore her life's work for two months (totally understandable, life happens), miss the emails, and then go *another* two months without trying to reactivate.\n\nIf you friend ran out of space, she would've only been restricted to what she could do in Confluence and as long as she either upgraded to a paid plan (only $6.70/month, paid monthly) or just kept logging back in every 59 days, her data would never have been deleted nor her account deactivated. Additionally, Atlassian provides built-in backup tools for users to use that are point and click.\n\nI am finding it difficult to have much anger at Atlassian in this situation.

# Assertions

## Bryan Guffey
- I think 4 reminders over 60 days to only log in to keep the site active plus another 60 to reactivate is more than reasonable
- log in once every six months. That’s reasonable.
- This isn't about tech regulation. There was ample warning and opportunity for her to address the issue.
- confusing, since Atlassian provided her four reminders over 60 days to simply *log in* and keep her site active and then another 60 days to simply reach out to support and ask them to reactivate her product before they deleted anything. 
- it’s true, but then there’s another 60 days post - deactivation. And if there’s a mistake, then it should be reversible.
- Reminding her four times that she needed to log back in to keep her site active? For asking her to pay $6.70/month if she wanted more storage? For giving her an additional 60 days after her site was deactivated to reactivate her account and still have access to all her data? For giving her built-it tools to back up her data?
- Atlassian begins sending emails 60 days prior to product deactivation due to inactivity.
- They send emails on day 60, day 30, day 7, and day 0. On day 0, they inform you that your product has been deactivated. At the time of deactivation, the site admin still has *another* 60 days to reactivate their account.
- If you friend ran out of space, she would've only been restricted to what she could do in Confluence and as long as she either upgraded to a paid plan (only $6.70/month, paid monthly) or just kept logging back in every 59 days, her data would never have been deleted nor her account deactivated. Additionally, Atlassian provides built-in backup tools for users to use that are point and click.
- four emails over 60 days, plus another 60 days to ensure that she could resolve the issue, before deletion, is pretty generous. And as long as she kept logging in, she'd have been just fine even if she ran out of space.
- it clearly wasn't deleted without warning. Atlassian sends multiple emails regarding deletion of sites. I think at least five or six. I know because I provision a lot of free sites.
- Eric Xanderson confused where 120 days of complete inactivity plus four reminders and a paltry $$6.70/month for perpetual availability is enshittification.
- Reminding her four times that she needed to log back in to keep her site active? For asking her to pay $6.70/month if she wanted more storage? For giving her an additional 60 days after her site was deactivated to reactivate her account and still have access to all her data? For giving her built-in tools to back up her data?

I've had this email from Atlassian a few times over the years. They don't just nuke an account to unrecoverable, with no warning - something's definitely off here.

## Fadoua M. B.
- This is a reminder to read the notification emails we get

## Andrew Day
- I don’t think the responsibility is being properly framed here.

## Johannes '🔥' Bertens
- Cloud services are convenient, but keep a backup of your valuables


## Bob Van Dell II
- Another way to think about this is that your colleague enjoyed the product Confluence's talented team of developers, product mangers, and others made possible for 10 years, but did not care enough about the hard work and labor that team put into it to pay them for it.

## David Eglin
- Say what you like about Atlassian, but their policies and processes are pretty well set out.
- Your friend will have been warned several times about their data, and then there will have been a period after deactivation for them to reactivate. 

## Daniel Liljeberg
- Look into suing them.

## Helen O
- In my experience, there are different types of Atlassian free accounts, depending on which mechanism you used to create them and also how long ago you created them. A 10 year user's account may indeed have different settings on it and therefore handled differently than a recently-created one using a mechanism that didn't exist 10 years ago.

## Reid Pinchback
- i ran into the exact same outcome this post was about with a paid account. I ditched them after even having a paid account didn't stop them trashing my work and it didn't take six months. Every few months I had to get customer service to restore what they had deleted, and I got sick of it.

## Javier Bonnemaison
- The point about regulation is that in a world where we put our lives online, often with the expectation that companies are operating in good faith and will protect and respect our content and privacy, there are no legal safeguards to compel companies to do this.
- Bryan Guffey Whatever business model Atlassian decided to deploy, it was based on their needs and strategy. They are not doing free users any favors, they simply assume that some of them will convert to paid and perhaps generate some positive reviews and/or referral sales, and they are calculating that this is a good investment. Offering this service in good faith includes taking reasonable measures to protect and preserve user content, as well as making it easy for people to take their content with them for any reason (I assume that Atlassian does not provide a tool to conveniently do this, as it would harm user lock-in, but I may be wrong).
- Caveat emptor is a political choice.
- Closing the account for inactivity or any other valid business reason does not have to imply immediate deletion of user data. 
- This is absolutely not the case in a freemium model. Companies still have a responsibility to protect your data.

## Keirstin Hafermann
- If it truly was 42 days, they breached policy. They typically require a 120 day inactivity period for free plans. Even then there is like a ~60 day grace period to reactivate (possibly by signing up for a paid plan).

when people swear it’s the company is pretty high. 

It’s not impossible that you had the experience you describe, no company is perfect, but it would far and away be the very rare minority experience.

I take objection to people simply assuming a story that files in the face of all of the stated policies of a company, with zero evidence of the facts, is true.

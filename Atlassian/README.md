## Internal Comment Classification (Posture → Motivation → Response)

### Rule-Certainty

- Motivational Lens:  
  Needs the world to be governed by clear, stable rules; restores personal safety by appealing to policy text and formal definitions.
- Response:  
  Do not engage individually. Address once via observable facts (dates, actions, outcomes). Avoid policy interpretation or quoting ToS.

### Recovery-Confidence

- Motivational Lens:  
  Hope-driven belief that systems must have backups or reversibility; attempts to resolve discomfort by asserting recoverability.
- Response:  
  Treat as hypotheses, not solutions. Test suggested paths if feasible. Report outcomes once in synthesis (“we tested X; result was Y”).

### Assumed-Safeguard

- Motivational Lens:  
  Projects personal vigilance onto others; needs to believe warnings, countdowns, and guardrails must have existed.
- Response:  
  Neutralize with dates, quoted messages, and actions only. No interpretation. No “they should have.” Let facts carry the weight.

### Norm-Normalization

- Motivational Lens:  
  Reduces discomfort by framing loss as ordinary, inevitable, or “just how SaaS works.”
- Response:  
  Acknowledge briefly in synthesis, then move on. Do not debate. Does not advance recovery or warning goals.

### Action-Offer

- Motivational Lens:  
  Genuine intent to help; often comes from prior experience, insider knowledge, or adjacent technical/legal exposure.
- Response:  
  Highest priority. Follow up privately via DM. Share timeline and observable facts. Keep out of public thread. These are your leverage points.

# Public Followup Post

## TODO

- Provide dates of emails. Indicate whether they included deadline for account access, deadline for data recovery, backup tools, export tools, or account upgrade options.  Good to acknowledge that emails arrived, and document that they were not helpful.  (Maybe)

## Timeline of Events - Extended

- September 29, 2025 (-1 day)
An Atlassian Customer Advocate, responding to a Billing & Licensing support request, stated in writing:

> “Confluence on a Free plan will be deactivated after 120 days of inactivity. To prevent your site from being deactivated, just log in and view any Confluence page — that’ll count as activity and reset the 120-day clock.”

- September 30, 2025 (Day 0)
I used my Confluence site extensively. Atlassian later confirmed that this activity occurred.

- November 30, 2025 (Day 61)
I was informed by a Billing & Licensing team member that:

> “Your Confluence subscription… was cancelled on November 13, 2025, due to inactivity.”

This meant that **just 44 days after confirmed use**, the site had been deactivated — and, following a 14-day soft-deletion window (**59 days**), permanently deleted due to “inactivity.”

- December 2025
For just over a month, I engaged in a sustained effort to understand what had happened and whether recovery was possible, involving multiple Atlassian teams.

- December 30, 2025
Atlassian Cloud Support informed me:

> “The inactivity period was updated from 120 days to 40 days. Unfortunately, there are no options to recover the data.”

At no point prior to deletion was a **40-day inactivity threshold** clearly communicated in a way that allowed me to make an informed decision about safeguarding my data.

- January 14, 2026
As of this date, I was unable to locate any publicly accessible Atlassian documentation that describes a 40-day inactivity threshold for Confluence Free plan sites. Public documentation references only deactivation after a general period of inactivity, without specifying a numeric value.

## Timeline of Events - Blended

## Post This

CURRENT (balanced / neutral)
Given the volume of comments about inactivity windows and recovery expectations, I want to clarify what actually occurred, based solely on written support responses and confirmed dates.

COOLER (more clinical / incident-report tone)
This post documents the sequence of events that led to the permanent deletion of a Confluence Cloud Free site, based on written Atlassian support responses and verified dates.

WARMER (slightly more human, still factual)
After many comments about how inactivity and recovery are supposed to work, I want to share the actual sequence of events, based on written support responses and confirmed dates.

- November 13, 2025 (Day 44)
According to Atlassian, the Confluence subscription was cancelled on this date due to “inactivity.”
(date inferred retroactively)

- November 27, 2025 (Day 58)
Following a 14-day soft-deletion window after cancellation, the Confluence site and its data were permanently deleted.
(date inferred retroactively)

- November 30, 2025 (Day 61)
I was informed by a Billing & Licensing team member that:

> “Your Confluence subscription… was cancelled on November 13, 2025, due to inactivity.”

At this point, login was no longer possible and all site data was inaccessible.

This meant that **just 44 days after confirmed use**, the site had been cancelled — and **58 days after confirmed use**, the data had been permanently deleted due to “inactivity.”

- December 2025
For just over a month, I engaged in a sustained effort to understand what had happened and whether recovery was possible, involving multiple Atlassian teams (Billing & Licensing, Customer Advocates, GDPR/Data Protection, and Confluence Cloud Support).

- December 30, 2025 (Day 91)
Atlassian Cloud Support informed me:

> “The inactivity period was updated from 120 days to 40 days. Unfortunately, there are no options to recover the data.”

At no point prior to deletion was a **40-day inactivity threshold** clearly communicated in a way that allowed me to make an informed decision about safeguarding my data.

- January 14, 2026 (Day 104)
As of this date, I was unable to locate any publicly accessible Atlassian documentation that describes a 40-day inactivity threshold for Confluence Free plan sites. Public documentation references only deactivation after a general period of inactivity, without specifying a numeric value.

- January 28, 2026 (Day 120)
This date marks the originally communicated inactivity window under which the site was expected to remain safe, based on prior written guidance.

Note on timeline reconstruction:
Some events are dated based on information provided later by Atlassian support, and were not known or visible at the time they occurred.  Dates were inferred retroactively from subsequent written communications.

Clarification
The Confluence site involved

- was approximately 7 years old
- was always on the Free plan.   A separate account moved between Free and Paid during a similar period.

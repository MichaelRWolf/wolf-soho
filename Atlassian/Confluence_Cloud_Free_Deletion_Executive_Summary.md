# Executive Summary  

## Confluence Cloud Free Site Deletion (Late 2025)

This executive summary distills a documented experience involving the permanent deletion of a long‑standing **Confluence Cloud Free** site due to inactivity.

The purpose is twofold:

1. To warn other users of data‑loss risk earlier than was apparent here.
2. To accurately reflect what Atlassian support confirmed *after* deletion occurred.

This is not a complaint or a request for special treatment. It is a factual account intended to help others act sooner.

## Key Findings

- A long‑standing Confluence Cloud Free site was deactivated and permanently deleted due to inactivity.
- Written guidance provided shortly before the incident stated a **120‑day inactivity window**.
- Atlassian support later confirmed that the inactivity window had been reduced to **approximately 40 days**.
- This reduced threshold was not clearly discoverable in public documentation at the time of deletion.
- Multiple Atlassian teams were engaged over several weeks.
- All teams ultimately confirmed that **no recovery path exists once deletion completes**.

## Practical Implications for Users

- **Free does not mean safe** for long‑term or valuable data.
- Inactivity thresholds can change.
- “Logging in counts as activity” depends on backend classification, not user intent.
- Email‑only warnings are fragile in a phishing‑saturated environment.
- **Export early. Export often.**

## Bottom Line

Users of Confluence Cloud Free should not assume continuity with prior guidance, generous safety margins, or recoverability after deletion.

If your data matters, take proactive steps to back it up — regardless of plan tier.

# Confluence deletes 10 years data after 42 days of inactivity

Confluence deletes 10 years data after 42 days of inactivity!

Atlassian seems to have redefined what "Free" means.

Formerly "Free Plan" allowed

- unlimited features
- unlimited time,
but with
- limited user count,
- limited storage space.

Over the years, as switched between "Free Plan" and paid plan numerous times. Through out the whole period, the data remained.

Now, "Free Plan" seems to mean

- unlimited features
- for a very limited time,
- with limited features (especially regarding data access).

In effect, they've replaced the "Free if you stay small" plan with the "Free to try (or die)" plan.

After nearly 6 weeks involving 10 iterations with various Atlassian departments, she has the same answer she heard 2 days after it was deleted - ALL HER DATA IS DELETED.  IRREVERSABLE.  FOREVER.  NO RECOURSE.

I have a request, and a warning.

Request - If you have any suggestions she may not have tried, please contact me.  This is a significant body of work - courses, testimonials, newsletters, correspondences, collaborative business building.

Warning - If you are not paying for a service, you do not own your data.  Perhaps this is not new (in the US), but the "implied contracts" that we once assumed can no longer be assumed.

Aside: This is part of a bigger trend at Atlassian.  There used to be simple ways to export data.  No longer.  You can export one page at a time, but to do bulk export requires a paid service or tool purchase.  After innovation stops attracting new customers, adding friction to the exit path helps with customer retention (AKA lock-in).  Some companies did this so strongly that they had class action law suits lodged against them for unfair business practices.

Hi Bryan —

Thanks again for engaging in the thread and sharing your perspective. I appreciate you doing that publicly, especially in a comment stream that attracted a lot of heat and side conversations.

I understand why, based on how Atlassian’s policies are usually described, this situation would sound unlikely. That expectation is exactly why we were surprised by what unfolded.

I posted a short public clarification today that lays out the sequence of events using confirmed dates and written support responses.

For additional context: my colleague has been a long-time Confluence user, has recommended it to others over the years, and has used paid Atlassian products for other work. This was a long-running, actively used site.

We’ve also documented a more detailed, source-backed timeline of the support interactions, in case that’s useful beyond the public summary. I’m happy to share that, or to walk through it on a call, if you think it would help interpret what we saw.

No obligation at all — but given your experience in the Atlassian ecosystem, I’d genuinely value your take on whether this fits any known edge cases, backend classifications, or recent changes that wouldn’t be obvious from public documentation.

Thanks for engaging thoughtfully.

I posted a short public follow-up summarizing what we were told in writing and what actually occurred, focused just on timelines and recovery expectations. It’s meant to clarify the facts, not to debate intent or assign fault.

For additional context, my colleague has been a long-time Confluence user, has recommended it to others over the years, and has used paid Atlassian products for other work. This wasn’t a casual or disposable setup, which shaped her expectations around safety margins and continuity.

Hi Bryan —

Thanks for engaging in the thread and sharing your perspective. I appreciate you doing that publicly, especially given how noisy comment streams can get.

I understand why, based on how Atlassian’s policies are usually described, this situation would sound unlikely. That expectation is exactly why we were surprised.

I posted a brief follow-up today summarizing what we were told in writing and what actually occurred. The short version is that our documented experience didn’t line up with the timelines or recovery expectations many people (reasonably) assume.

Given your background and long experience in the Atlassian ecosystem, I’d genuinely value your take on whether what we saw fits any known edge cases, backend classifications, or policy changes that wouldn’t be obvious from public documentation.

No obligation at all — but if you’re willing to take a look and share a perspective, I’d appreciate it.

Thanks again for engaging thoughtfully.

Hi Bryan —

Thanks for engaging on the thread and for staying with it as the conversation grew. I also saw your repost and the note that this is upsetting.

Our experience ended up being different from what you’ve described, so we pulled together a short, factual summary of what actually happened — dates, messages we received, actions taken, and the outcome. We posted it as a follow-up to keep the discussion grounded in observable facts.

Given your long experience with Atlassian, I’d value your perspective on that summary, particularly whether you see any practical course of action we should pursue next.

Thanks for taking a look, and for engaging thoughtfully.

Confluence deleted 10 years of work after 42 days of inactivity.

Not archived.
Not suspended.
**Deleted.**

A colleague of mine just lost a decade of courses, client work, and personal writing because Atlassian seems to have changed what “Free” means.

It used to mean *free if you stay small*.

Now it means *free for a limited time, with no backup or data retention policy"

After six weeks and ten support escalations, the answer hasn’t changed:
**Confluence will not restore it.**

If you know any recovery paths she hasn’t tried, please reach out. This data represents a huge part of her life's work.

And if you’re using free SaaS tools for anything that matters, assume this can happen to you too.

Kevin Mireles I think 4 reminders over 60 days to only log in to keep the site active plus another 60 to reactivate is more than reasonable, and if the issue was that she ran out of storage, she could've spent less than $7/month to have more storage. Plus, free backup tools are available so I'm not sure how this is Atlassian's fault.

Bryan Guffey no, it isn't reasonable, because Atlassian is not the center of the universe. 

Humans are busy and they have multiple dimensions of activity. Having one business constantly screaming "pay attention to me, pay attention to me!" is nonsense. 

I used to use Atlassian products, tried the various free and paid lower-tier offerings over the years, used to be a pretty consistent booster for some of the products with clients, but as a consultant I got fed up with having my Jira and Confluence totally trashed if I was focused on client work instead of home office projects for 6 months. 

Just because the world has created an attention economy does not mean that having that forced down everyone's throat 24x7 is reasonable. What is reasonable is not having to give 2 effs about a piece of software when I don't have any reason right now to have it on my radar. My attention belongs to *me*. Companies that can't respect something that fundamental deserve to find churn metrics eating their business.

Reid Pinchback bro. log in once every six months. That’s reasonable. You can say it’s not, but sparing 30 seconds for perpetual free storage and compute is a damn good deal. On top of that, $7/mo and you dont ever have to log in. 

And guess what? If you’re so upset by a tiny bit of friction for free shit, you’re not worth it to Atlassian.

Bryan Guffey i ran into the exact same outcome this post was about with a paid account. I ditched them after even having a paid account didn't stop them trashing my work and it didn't take six months. Every few months I had to get customer service to restore what they had deleted, and I got sick of it. 

Try ditching the toxic attitude and turning it into something vaguely approximating professionalism.

Reid Pinchback mmm okay. Show me the receipts. I’ve been in this business for 20+ years and the number of times the issue is PEBCAK when people swear it’s the company is pretty high. 

It’s not impossible that you had the experience you describe, no company is perfect, but it would far and away be the very rare minority experience.

I take objection to people simply assuming a story that files in the face of all of the stated policies of a company, with zero evidence of the facts, is true.

Let this be a lesson for everyone. Tech regulation is practically inexistent. I use markdown-based Obsidian locally for all my documents (migrated from Evernote and couldn't be happier) and do the same (local) for everything I can, like LLMs (ollama) and security camera footage, for example.

Bryan Guffey While it's true that I don't have knowledge of the details (perhaps you can enlighten me), why should Atlassian unilaterally decide what is reasonable, and how do they balance their cost management policies with destroying years of intellectual property that has been entrusted to them? The point about regulation is that in a world where we put our lives online, often with the expectation that companies are operating in good faith and will protect and respect our content and privacy, there are no legal safeguards to compel companies to do this.

Javier Bonnemaison because Atlassian is the one paying for the storage of all her data. Atlassian is the one keeping her instance of the platform running. Atlassian is the one assuming all of the ongoing costs of providing her a space to work. There is an exchange there and I’m perfectly fine with there being a reasonable and equitable exchange of value.

Ben Ford every single one of Atlassian’s primary competitors are Cloud-only. Atlassian was at risk of continually falling behind trying to shop for two very differently-developed platforms or risk undergoing a significant rewrite in order to unify the codebases for a rapidly shrinking piece of the customer base, while the part of the customer base that’s growing is all-SaaS. 

As someone who has been in the ecosystem for 20 years, cut my teeth running all of Atlassian’s products on hardwareI owned, and still to this day work primarily on self-hosted Atlassian instances (nearly every single Atlassian product still has a self-hosted version available and will until 2029 with support until 2032), Atlassian is making the smart business decision and the decision that is, long-term, best for its customers.

Ben Ford oh and did you know that when Atlassian discontinued the Ssrver versions of its products it also made sure that those licenses remained perpetual for the rest of time for those still using the product? 

Not only that, but every one of those people who own Server version of any Atlassian product have access to the full source code for the product so they’re able to patch and update and extend it for the rest of time.

They also gave people like, at least two years’ notice. 

Seems pretty customer-friendly to me.

Bryan Guffey Whatever business model Atlassian decided to deploy, it was based on their needs and strategy. They are not doing free users any favors, they simply assume that some of them will convert to paid and perhaps generate some positive reviews and/or referral sales, and they are calculating that this is a good investment. Offering this service in good faith includes taking reasonable measures to protect and preserve user content, as well as making it easy for people to take their content with them for any reason (I assume that Atlassian does not provide a tool to conveniently do this, as it would harm user lock-in, but I may be wrong). Ultimately, they are free to change their commercial terms, but they still have a responsibility to protect user content to the best of their abilities. Regulation could, for example, require companies to archive user accounts for a full year after termination in a portable format (like markdown) and contact users repeatedly via multiple channels if possible. In the current world, if a manager decides that they want to cut storage costs or make some other KPI look better this quarter, and that involves deleting user accounts after minimal warning, users have no recourse whatsoever.

Michael Vizdos confusing, since Atlassian provided her four reminders over 60 days to simply *log in* and keep her site active and then another 60 days to simply reach out to support and ask them to reactivate her product before they deleted anything. Also, Atlassian doesn't use that data, nor do they run third-party advertisements, and this is exactly why they can't provide forever-free products that people don't use (They're happy to give you forever free as long as your storage usage is under 2GB).

Bryan Guffey In my experience, there are different types of Atlassian free accounts, depending on which mechanism you used to create them and also how long ago you created them. A 10 year user's account may indeed have different settings on it and therefore handled differently than a recently-created one using a mechanism that didn't exist 10 years ago.

Simply because of my experience with this, and inside Atlassian, I am inclined to give the user the benefit of the doubt that they DID in fact log in within the past 60 days. Mistakes do happen at Atlassian, as they do everywhere.

> Now it means *free for a limited time, with no backup or data retention policy*

Now? Was there ever a policy for restoring your free stuff from a backup? Does that exist ANYWHERE? I have always assumed that that does not exist. I wouldn't expect LinkedIn to do it, barring the fact that they're a social media company and killing your livestock because you forgot to feed or water them tends to be bad for the rancher. (Make backups of your LinkedIn content from time to time, folks!) Furthermore it sounds like there *is* a data retention policy. The whole point of retention policies is so that you can DELETE stuff at some point in time and not find yourself on the wrong end of a court order for discovery.

Michael, if you are in a circle which doesn't understand the above, be an agent of light and not darkness.

(And "Hi!" and I hope you're doing well...)

So yeah, cool, totally evil, except for the part where their products enabled the existence of an organization that has saved hundreds of people from self-harm.

This is terrible. It’s also why I keep everything important in version control. Even if GitHub goes away, I have it locally and can push it elsewhere.

Atlassian begins sending emails 60 days prior to product deactivation due to inactivity. 

They send emails on day 60, day 30, day 7, and day 0. On day 0, they inform you that your product has been deactivated. At the time of deactivation, the site admin still has *another* 60 days to reactivate their account. 

This means your friend managed to ignore her life's work for two months (totally understandable, life happens), miss the emails, and then go *another* two months without trying to reactivate. 

If you friend ran out of space, she would've only been restricted to what she could do in Confluence and as long as she either upgraded to a paid plan (only $6.70/month, paid monthly) or just kept logging back in every 59 days, her data would never have been deleted nor her account deactivated. Additionally, Atlassian provides built-in backup tools for users to use that are point and click. 

I am finding it difficult to have much anger at Atlassian in this situation. I feel for your friend, but if this was much of her life's work, it also feels like a significant lack of personal responsibility for this data.

Yeah… this just doesn’t ring quite true, I’m afraid. At very least it’s not the whole truth. Say what you like about Atlassian, but their policies and processes are pretty well set out. 

Your friend will have been warned several times about their data, and then there will have been a period after deactivation for them to reactivate. At the end of the day, we can’t expect companies to keep inactive data indefinitely, especially not for free accounts. 

I think the real lesson here is that, if you value something enough, if it represents a significant portion of your life’s work… perhaps consider paying for the platform you are storing it on.

Look into suing them. Depending on which country your colleague resides in they could very well be responsible for deleting his data like that. As long as he has upheld his part of the agreement he entered. Also, the simple prospect of potentially being sued might also make them find a way to restore the data.

Bryan Guffey Pretty generous according to you. What if her email had changed or didn't forward correctly. What if her mother died or she went on a three month vacation? There are other options that are less final than deleting the account and all their contents after 60 days and only using one channel of communication. I sense we are not going to agree, so I won't pester you further.

Oh my, that’s an extremely brutal frustrating lesson for sure. My heart goes out to your friend.

I don’t think that Atlassian is to blame here, though. 

There are three fundamental rules for safeguarding business continuity:
1. Make backups from day one
2. Make backups elsewhere from day one
3. Automate all your backups from day one

Exactly _because_ life happens and you might not be capable of doing what’s necessary when something unexpected happens. 

It’s mindblowing how many people still naively rely on a single storage for their most valuable data. Both professionally and in their private life. Help them become aware, please.

It's almost like some commenters here have never had to carry a mental load of elder or child care, especially during an emergency. Or have their own life/health emergency (fed medical leave is 12 weeks for a reason,  y'all. Time flies when you're in care mode). Or heck just change emails and miss one change accidentally. Or get hacked, lose access, and spend months getting nowhere with terrible support. Or just not be terribly techy and misunderstand the issue. 

Instead:
I'm so sorry that happened! It sure seems like direct deletion is not a great route. It's a good reminder for all of us, too, that it's so important to have backup plans and good record keeping. I do hope there's a better outcome for your friend soon.

Another way to think about this is that your colleague enjoyed the product Confluence's talented team of developers, product mangers, and others made possible for 10 years, but did not care enough about the hard work and labor that team put into it to pay them for it.

I am not inclined to feel sympathy for the moral lesson your colleague is learning from this: pay people for their work.

If after 10 years, you're still too small to pay for Confluence, you've got a bigger problem than losing your Confluence data.

Even not-for-profit companies earn revenue to cover the overhead required for them to deliver on their mission.

Bob Van Dell II You make a good point, but there is no need to punish people for taking advantage of a freemium model by deleting their data in an aggressive time frame. Closing the account for inactivity or any other valid business reason does not have to imply immediate deletion of user data. For example, a company could email a link to an export file and save that file for a longer period of time, for example.

If it truly was 42 days, they breached policy. They typically require a 120 day inactivity period for free plans. Even then there is like a ~60 day grace period to reactivate (possibly by signing up for a paid plan).

If your friend didn't adhere to those, or whatever T&Cs were in their plan...there likely isn't a recovery path. Not because they don't want to - but the inactivity and grace period elapsed. 

That data has to live somewhere, and you are paying for it either in cash through a paid plan or activity in a free plan. 

In this instance - it wasn't about paying for a service with money. It was about paying for a service in activity they likely use to advertise/inform development of their product.

Unfortunate to be sure. More concerning is their loss of business when moving to purely SaaS with EoL of their Data Center product in 2029 and realistically before that: https://www.atlassian.com/licensing/data-center-end-of-life. Many of us have been worried this day would come.

Ensure that every important thing always exists in more than one place. Let the number of places and distance between them be proportional to the importance of the thing.

Anytime this is found to be untrue, it must be because it's impossible (one cannot create a backup copy of a human or a forest), because the thing is not actually as important as we thought, or because we failed to do something.

Corollary: Anything that is not used will not be maintained.

For giving her an additional 60 days after her site was deactivated to reactivate her account and still have access to all her data? For giving her built-in tools to back up her data?

Having one business constantly screaming \"pay attention to me, pay attention to me!\" is nonsense.\n\nI used to use Atlassian products, tried the various free and paid lower-tier offerings over the years, used to be a pretty consistent booster for some of the products with clients, but as a consultant I got fed up with having my Jira and Confluence totally trashed if I was focused on client work instead of home office projects for 6 months.\n\nJust because the world has created an attention economy does not mean that having that forced down everyone's throat 24x7 is reasonable. What is reasonable is not having to give 2 effs about a piece of software when I don't have any reason right now to have it on my radar. My attention belongs to *me*.

They are not doing free users any favors, they simply assume that some of them will convert to paid and perhaps generate some positive reviews and/or referral sales, and they are calculating that this is a good investment. Offering this service in good faith includes taking reasonable measures to protect and preserve user content, as well as making it easy for people to take their content with them for any reason (I assume that Atlassian does not provide a tool to conveniently do this, as it would harm user lock-in, but I may be wrong). Ultimately, they are free to change their commercial terms, but they still have a responsibility to protect user content to the best of their abilities. Regulation could, for example, require companies to archive user accounts for a full year after termination in a portable format (like markdown) and contact users repeatedly via multiple channels if possible. In the current world, if a manager decides that they want to cut storage costs or make some other KPI look better this quarter, and that involves deleting user accounts after minimal warning, users have no recourse whatsoever.",

I have always assumed that that does not exist. I wouldn't expect LinkedIn to do it, barring the fact that they're a social media company and killing your livestock because you forgot to feed or water them tends to be bad for the rancher. (Make backups of your LinkedIn content from time to time, folks!) Furthermore it sounds like there *is* a data retention policy. The whole point of retention policies is so that you can DELETE stuff at some point in time and not find yourself on the wrong end of a court order for discovery.\n\nMichael, if you are in a circle which doesn't understand the above, be an agent of light and not darkness.\n\n(And \"Hi!\" and I hope you're doing well...)",

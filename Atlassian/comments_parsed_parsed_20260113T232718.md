Kevin Mireles I think 4 reminders over 60 days to only log in to keep the site active plus another 60 to reactivate is more than reasonable, and if the issue was that she ran out of storage, she could've spent less than $7/month to have more storage. Plus, free backup tools are available so I'm not sure how this is Atlassian's fault.

## Reid Pinchback

Bryan Guffey no, it isn't reasonable, because Atlassian is not the center of the universe.

Humans are busy and they have multiple dimensions of activity. Having one business constantly screaming "pay attention to me, pay attention to me!" is nonsense.

I used to use Atlassian products, tried the various free and paid lower-tier offerings over the years, used to be a pretty consistent booster for some of the products with clients, but as a consultant I got fed up with having my Jira and Confluence totally trashed if I was focused on client work instead of home office projects for 6 months.

Just because the world has created an attention economy does not mean that having that forced down everyone's throat 24x7 is reasonable. What is reasonable is not having to give 2 effs about a piece of software when I don't have any reason right now to have it on my radar. My attention belongs to *me*. Companies that can't respect something that fundamental deserve to find churn metrics eating their business.

Reid Pinchback bro. log in once every six months. That’s reasonable. You can say it’s not, but sparing 30 seconds for perpetual free storage and compute is a damn good deal. On top of that, $7/mo and you dont ever have to log in.

And guess what? If you’re so upset by a tiny bit of friction for free shit, you’re not worth it to Atlassian.

As someone who has been in the ecosystem for 20 years, cut my teeth running all of Atlassian’s products on hardwareI owned, and still to this day work primarily on self-hosted Atlassian instances (nearly every single Atlassian product still has a self-hosted version available and will until 2029 with support until 2032), Atlassian is making the smart business decision and the decision that is, long-term, best for its customers.

Bryan Guffey Whatever business model Atlassian decided to deploy, it was based on their needs and strategy. They are not doing free users any favors, they simply assume that some of them will convert to paid and perhaps generate some positive reviews and/or referral sales, and they are calculating that this is a good investment. Offering this service in good faith includes taking reasonable measures to protect and preserve user content, as well as making it easy for people to take their content with them for any reason (I assume that Atlassian does not provide a tool to conveniently do this, as it would harm user lock-in, but I may be wrong). Ultimately, they are free to change their commercial terms, but they still have a responsibility to protect user content to the best of their abilities. Regulation could, for example, require companies to archive user accounts for a full year after termination in a portable format (like markdown) and contact users repeatedly via multiple channels if possible. In the current world, if a manager decides that they want to cut storage costs or make some other KPI look better this quarter, and that involves deleting user accounts after minimal warning, users have no recourse whatsoever.

Michael Vizdos confusing, since Atlassian provided her four reminders over 60 days to simply *log in* and keep her site active and then another 60 days to simply reach out to support and ask them to reactivate her product before they deleted anything. Also, Atlassian doesn't use that data, nor do they run third-party advertisements, and this is exactly why they can't provide forever-free products that people don't use (They're happy to give you forever free as long as your storage usage is under 2GB).

## Helen O

Bryan Guffey In my experience, there are different types of Atlassian free accounts, depending on which mechanism you used to create them and also how long ago you created them. A 10 year user's account may indeed have different settings on it and therefore handled differently than a recently-created one using a mechanism that didn't exist 10 years ago.

Simply because of my experience with this, and inside Atlassian, I am inclined to give the user the benefit of the doubt that they DID in fact log in within the past 60 days. Mistakes do happen at Atlassian, as they do everywhere.

(Make backups of your LinkedIn content from time to time, folks!) Furthermore it sounds like there *is* a data retention policy. The whole point of retention policies is so that you can DELETE stuff at some point in time and not find yourself on the wrong end of a court order for discovery.

Atlassian begins sending emails 60 days prior to product deactivation due to inactivity.

They send emails on day 60, day 30, day 7, and day 0. On day 0, they inform you that your product has been deactivated. At the time of deactivation, the site admin still has *another* 60 days to reactivate their account.

This means your friend managed to ignore her life's work for two months (totally understandable, life happens), miss the emails, and then go *another* two months without trying to reactivate.

If you friend ran out of space, she would've only been restricted to what she could do in Confluence and as long as she either upgraded to a paid plan (only $6.70/month, paid monthly) or just kept logging back in every 59 days, her data would never have been deleted nor her account deactivated. Additionally, Atlassian provides built-in backup tools for users to use that are point and click.

I am finding it difficult to have much anger at Atlassian in this situation. I feel for your friend, but if this was much of her life's work, it also feels like a significant lack of personal responsibility for this data.

I am not inclined to feel sympathy for the moral lesson your colleague is learning from this: pay people for their work.

If it truly was 42 days, they breached policy. They typically require a 120 day inactivity period for free plans. Even then there is like a ~60 day grace period to reactivate (possibly by signing up for a paid plan).

If your friend didn't adhere to those, or whatever T&Cs were in their plan...there likely isn't a recovery path. Not because they don't want to - but the inactivity and grace period elapsed.

That data has to live somewhere, and you are paying for it either in cash through a paid plan or activity in a free plan.

I noticed Atlassian are a sponsor to an F1 team (Williams maybe).

A long shot, but they might care of their perceived image more on an F1 forum than on a support thread. So if you can figure out how to make it stink for them over there, maybe one of their marketing/image people can care enough to engage

This is a reminder to read the notification emails we get, not to setup a filter and have them deleted automatically or disregard them. I feel bad for you that you lost this much data.

enshittification is the business model to rule a sociopathic business class for technology.

Eric Xanderson confused where 120 days of complete inactivity plus four reminders and a paltry $$6.70/month for perpetual availability is enshittification.

Craig Cockburn I've had this email from Atlassian a few times over the years. They don't just nuke an account to unrecoverable, with no warning - something's definitely off here.

Didn’t JWZ say something about this: you have an organization problem. “I know” you say, “I’ll use atlassian”. Now you have two problems.

Really sorry to hear this, Michael Wolf. Situations like this are exactly why we built Rewind. It’s meant to give you a safety net so important work doesn’t just disappear, and so recovery is simple when things go sideways. Let me know if there’s any way we can help.

Internet Archive? ( Always a good idea to backup. )

Are there more details?
Did Atlassian send emails in advance? What was exactly reason for canceling his account?

Same here but luckily that was a throwaway account with all AI generated stuff.

I am so sorry for your friend but I'm so glad you posted this. This is an outstanding cautionary tale. Atlassian should be ashamed.

## Bryan Guffey

AJ Omernik ashamed of what? Reminding her four times that she needed to log back in to keep her site active? For asking her to pay $6.70/month if she wanted more storage? For giving her an additional 60 days after her site was deactivated to reactivate her account and still have access to all her data? For giving her built-in tools to back up her data?

What should they be ashamed of?

Ryan M. I’ve been logging in every month to maintain a small number of not terribly important documents in confluence and finally decided to just let them go. Also, we switched over to youtrack from Jira. So far seems like a decent enough product for a small team.

### 2025-08-25: Email Setup Journey - From Domain Dreams to 2015 Reality

**Progress Made:**
- ✅ Domain `runningwolf.net` successfully configured with Fastmail
- ✅ Nameservers updated to Fastmail's infrastructure (ns1/ns2.messagingengine.com)
- ✅ Web hosting disabled - domain is email-only as intended
- ✅ Admin account `michaelrwolf@fastmail.com` functional
- ✅ Webmail interface accessible and working

**The 2015 Brick Wall:**
- ❌ Spark (2015-era email client) auto-detection fails with custom domains
- ❌ `michael@runningwolf.net` and `wendy@runningwolf.net` cannot be added to Spark
- ❌ Manual IMAP/SMTP configuration required but still fails
- ❌ Domain-specific webmail (`mail.runningwolf.net`) only works over HTTP (security warning)
- ❌ 5 hours of setup time wasted on client compatibility issues

**Key Insight - The MUA Gap:**
Discovered the fundamental divide in email client landscape:
- **2015 Era (Free/Low-Cost)**: Spark, Mail.app, Thunderbird - basic features, poor auto-detection, manual configuration hell
- **2025 Luxury Tier ($1/day/user)**: Superhuman ($30/month), Front ($20/month), Hey.com ($99/year) - AI-powered, modern features, actually works

**The Email Client Reality Check:**
- **Mail.app**: Dead horse beaten for 15 years, not a contender
- **Spark**: "Top recommendation" but 2015-era auto-detection can't handle 2024 custom domains
- **Webmail**: Hygiene factor, not a solution for power users
- **Modern MUAs**: Aristocratic pricing ($20-30/month) for features that actually work

**Options Moving Forward:**
1. **Mail.app Fuckery**: Known quantity, 15 years of pain, but predictable
2. **Webmail Mediocrity**: Fastmail.com webmail only - works but no advanced features
3. **Better MUA Arcanity**: Manual configuration, more fighting with 2015-era software
4. **Modern MUA Aristocracy**: Pay $20-30/month for Superhuman/Front - actually works, set-and-forget for 15 years

**Conclusion:** Email clients are fundamentally broken in 2024. The choice is between free bullshit that doesn't work and expensive solutions that do. Webmail is the only reliable option for those unwilling to pay aristocracy prices.

**Time Invested:** 5 hours
**Result:** Working domain setup, broken client integration, clarity on email client landscape

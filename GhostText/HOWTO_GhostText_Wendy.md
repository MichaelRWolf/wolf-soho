# HOWTO: Using GhostText (Wendy Edition)

This guide is for **everyday use**, not setup or troubleshooting.

GhostText is here for **one reason**:
> **So you never lose text you are typing into fields on web pages.**

You do not need to understand how it works. Just follow the steps.

---

## What GhostText Does (Plain Language)

- Web page text fields are **fragile**
- GhostText mirrors what you type into a **safe editor window**
- If the browser crashes, your words are **still there**

Think of it as:
> *A safety net for thinking and drafting on the web.*

---

## Browser Reality Check (Important)

### **Chrome works. Safari NEVER will.**

This is not a preference issue. It is a technical reality.

- **Chrome:** GhostText works reliably and protects your writing
- **Safari:** GhostText does **not** work reliably and should be treated as **unsafe for important writing**

If you use Safari for writing that matters, you are back to:
> **“Oh fuck, I lost hours of work.”**

There is **no safety net** in Safari.

Safari is fine for:
- reading
- browsing
- casual, disposable typing

Safari is **not** fine for:
- thinking
- drafting
- newsletters
- website text
- anything you would be upset to lose

---

## The Golden Rule

> **If the writing matters, use GhostText.**

Use GhostText when you are **actually thinking and drafting**, not just casually typing.

Why:
- While GhostText is active, the editor is holding your words in a **buffer**
- A *buffer* is safe, stable, and **not tied to a file yet**
- This is ideal for thinking, drafting, revising, and exploring language

If it’s quick, trivial, or disposable, you can type directly into fields on web pages.

---

## How to Use GhostText (Daily Steps)

### Before you start: choose the right browser

- Casual reading or quick notes → **Safari is fine**
- **Thinking, drafting, or important writing → use Chrome**

#### If you start in Safari and suddenly realize “this matters”:

1. **Stop typing**
2. Open the same page in **Chrome**
3. Turn on **GhostText**
4. Continue writing there

This one small transition prevents data loss.

---

### 1️⃣ Start typing where you normally would

Examples include **places where writing really matters**:

- ChatGPT message box
- Email drafts
- Social media posts or comments
- Newsletter writing tools
- Website creation tools
- Any long or thoughtful web form

Click **inside the text box first**.

---

### 2️⃣ Turn on GhostText

- Click the 👻 **GhostText** icon in the browser toolbar
- Choose **Visual Studio Code** when asked

You will see:
- A text window opens on the computer
- Your words appear there

You are now safe.

---

### 3️⃣ Type normally

You can:
- Type in the **editor window**
- OR type in the **browser**

Both stay in sync automatically.

---

## Saving Your Writing (Two Different Meanings)

There are **two kinds of saving**. They are not the same.

### 1️⃣ Safety-saving (automatic)

This happens automatically when GhostText is on.

- Your words live in the editor buffer
- You are protected from browser crashes, tab reloads, and network failures
- You do nothing

This turns:
> “Oh fuck, I lost everything”

into:
> **“I’m fine — the text is still there.”**

As long as the editor window is open, your work is safe.

---

### 2️⃣ File-saving (intentional)

Use this when:
- the thinking is done (or done enough)
- you want to keep a version

Important:
> **File-saving creates a snapshot.**

- Saving writes a file to disk
- Live 2‑way sync may stop for that buffer
- That is normal and OK

Recommended place to save:
```
~/WebForms
```

You can save anywhere that makes sense to you.

This is still **fuck‑loads less fragile** than a browser tab, field, or network connection.

---

## If the Browser or Tab Crashes (THIS IS THE MONEY SHOT)

### First: do NOT panic

Old story:
> “Oh fuck. I lost hours of work.”

New reality:
> **You did not lose anything.**

Your words are still in the editor.

---

### A) If GhostText reconnects automatically

1. Reopen the browser page
2. Click inside the text field
3. Click the 👻 **GhostText** icon

If the text appears:
- Keep going
- You are fully recovered

---

### B) If GhostText does NOT reconnect to the same buffer

This can happen. It is still fine.

Do this:

1. **Do NOT close the editor window**
2. Select all text (**⌘A**) and copy (**⌘C**)
3. Click inside the browser text field
4. Paste (**⌘V**)
5. Click the 👻 **GhostText** icon again

You are now reattached.

---

### What NOT to do

Do **not**:
- close the editor in frustration
- start rewriting from memory
- assume the work is gone

It isn’t.

---

### The new story

Instead of:
> “I lost everything.”

It becomes:
> **“Thank God for GhostText (and Michael). I didn’t lose a thing.”**

As long as:
- the editor window is open
- you follow the steps above

Your work is safe.

---

## When Something Feels Wrong

If:
- GhostText doesn’t open
- The editor window doesn’t appear
- You feel unsure

Stop and ask for help.

You did not break anything.

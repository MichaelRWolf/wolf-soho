# Request for Passive PoE Setup Approval

Dear [Recipient Name],

I would like to set up a network configuration in our RV that uses a **passive Power over Ethernet (PoE)** solution for powering and connecting a UniFi AC Mesh device.

## Proposed Setup

- **Inside the RV**
  - Passive PoE injector (e.g., GPOE-1-* model)
  - DC power supply (12â€“36V) connected to the injector
  - LAN data input from the Beryl router into the injector's "LAN" port
  - PoE output from the injector's "PoE" port

- **Outside the RV**
  - Single Cat5e/Cat6 Ethernet cable from the injector's PoE output to the UniFi AC Mesh
  - This single cable will carry both power and data to the device

## Benefits

- Eliminates the need to run an additional AC power cord outside
- Reduces cable clutter and complexity
- Maintains flexibility for power source options (RV DC system or shore power via adapter)

Please let me know if you approve this configuration, or if there are specific requirements or limitations I need to consider.

Thank you,  
[Your Name]

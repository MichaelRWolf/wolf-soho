## Email to Adam - 2025-09-02

Hi Adam,

I hope this finds you well as summer shifts into late summer, back-to-school season, and B√©la‚Äôs return.

First, thank you for all the infrastructure work you did at Trails End and Lake Effect. We're back for a fourth summer largely because of those efforts. I love how both the water pipes and data pipes became ‚Äúfarm systems‚Äù in your hands.

As technomads, we especially appreciate the WiFi. It far exceeds expectations‚Äîallowing us to meet with clients across the country (and world) from an off‚Äëgrid campsite that‚Äôs still on the internet!

That said, Zoom calls sometimes drop. Infrequent as they are, they‚Äôre disruptive. Remote work depends on a stable connection.

I‚Äôve done quite a bit of monitoring, debugging, configuring, and research. ChatGPT and Claude have been invaluable, but I‚Äôve reached the limit of what I can solve alone.

Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôve tried so far:

**Done:**

1. Repositioned my mobile router while tracking signal strength, noise, and errors. For a device designed for airports and hotels, it‚Äôs doing a yeoman‚Äôs job, but there‚Äôs little room for improvement.

**Attempted (but unsuccessful):**

1. Tried running a Ubiquiti device in stand‚Äëalone mode. I bought the same model Katya uses, hoping it could connect to *Trails End WiFi* instead of my mobile router. I couldn‚Äôt get it working.

**Possible next steps:**

1. **Adopt my Ubiquiti device into the existing mesh.** I believe this is how Katya‚Äôs setup works. The device is factory‚Äëreset and ready. Once adopted, it would be powered by our house battery, available to anyone nearby, and managed alongside existing APs. Likely just a quick setup.
2. **Join a different network.** The public SSID may optimize for speed, but what I need is predictability and stability. Even when Zoom is flaky, available bandwidth is 10‚Äì20√ó what‚Äôs required‚Äîit‚Äôs the dropped connections that matter.

Could you point me in the right direction?

Thanks,
Michael

*Adopting Ubiquiti Device:*

* Model: Ubiquiti UAP‚ÄëAC‚ÄëM‚ÄëUS (same as Katya‚Äôs)
* MAC Address: D8\:B3:70\:CC\:AA:7C
* Status: Factory reset, ready for adoption
* Power: PoE injector and mounting hardware available
* Preference: Integration into existing mesh (not standalone)
* Compliance: Happy to follow network policies and naming conventions
* Documentation: Will provide setup notes for future reference

*Alternative approaches (if adoption isn‚Äôt feasible):*

* Private SSID with device MAC allow‚Äëlist
* QoS prioritization for work traffic
* Band steering adjustments
* Channel selection guidance

Howdy Micheal, 

Good to hear from you. Sorry I'm just getting back to you, things have been quite busy here, and I've fallen behind in emails. 

First off; disclosures. üòâ I'm no longer running the network up there. I handed that off to Jeff in the spring at Aarons request. 

That being said, I do still have full admin access, and could probably help you get your uap mesh adopted. In fact, most likely if you give it a factory reset, and power it up, It will show up in my dashboard for adoption. Shoot me a text when it's fired up.

Also, I appreciate the offer of systems checking the bus. I think B√©la left it in good order, but I certainly wouldn't complain if you dropped by and had a look. I think the keys are in the door.

## Email to Adam - Adopting Ubiquiti and addressing jitter - 2025-09-28

Howdy Adam,

Good to hear from you too, and no worries about the timing‚ÄîI know it's harvest season.

I have powered up my Ubiquiti UAP-AC-M-US device. I attempted a 60-second factory reset that seemed to hang, then a 30-second reset that seemed to complete. I will keep it powered while the sun shines. Since we are now in site 1, it should be easy to adopt. The device model is UAP-AC-M-US with MAC address D8:B3:70:CC:AA:7C, and it's factory reset and ready for adoption.

When I offered to help out with solar panel re-installation, Aaron said you may be on site to assist, too. I'd enjoy that, and to learn what you've been up to. (Aside, while you're here, feel welcome to join us for dinner.)

I will do a quick check at the bus.

I am now unsure if adopting the Ubiquiti device will be sufficient. Subsequent learning and monitoring has had me realize that signal strength and download/upload speed is sufficient for normal email and browsing, but the problem with Zoom (and other HTTPS/streaming tools) is the connection stability and network jitter. The bandwidth is more than adequate‚Äîit's the intermittent connection drops and latency spikes that disrupt video calls. We're probably OK for this year, but it would be good to know if you think this is addressable for next year.

Thanks,
Michael
